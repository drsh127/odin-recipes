        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            I tend to lean towards muffins over a loaf simply for self control and especially when chocolate is involved. These are the muffins I will be eating all summer long. They are dark and rich and unbelievably moist from the zucchini and almond butter. They are also grain free, sweetened with maple syrup and sprinkled with salt. They are the perfect excuse to eat vegetables while indulging a chocolate craving!
