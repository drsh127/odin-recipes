        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            We’ve been digging golden milk for a while now, so it was due time to share my go-to recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you haven’t tried golden milk yet, you’re missing out! It’s a creamy (dairy-free), hot milk drink that’s filled to the brim with nutrients. Yes, a delicious beverage with health benefits. Dreams do come true.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups light coconut milk (or sub other dairy-free milk of choice)</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups unsweetened plain almond milk (DIY or store-bought)</li>
            <li>1 ½ tsp ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground ginger (or 1 tsp freshly grated ginger*)</li>
            <li>1 whole cinnamon stick (or 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp coconut oil (optional for richness // see notes for oil-free)</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Sweetener of choice (i.e. maple syrup, coconut sugar, or stevia to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To a small saucepan, add coconut milk, almond milk, turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, coconut oil (optional), black pepper, and sweetener of choice (I usually add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) maple syrup // adjust amount if altering number of servings).</li>
            <li>Whisk to combine and warm over medium heat. Heat until hot to the touch but not boiling – about 4 minutes – whisking frequently.</li>
            <li>Turn off heat and taste to adjust flavor. Add more sweetener to taste or more turmeric or ginger for intense spice + flavor.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, dividing between two glasses and leaving the cinnamon stick behind. Best when fresh, though leftovers can be stored covered in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Reheat on the stovetop or microwave until hot.</li>
        </ol>
